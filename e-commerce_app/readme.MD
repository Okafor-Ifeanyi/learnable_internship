Task on Javascript Fundamentals - Build a simple e-commerce console application.

A Breif run through of my code 

E-commerce Application - would be defined as an application where you can surf through the items available, pick some and get the total cost for payment. 

With this explanation above these are the steps I took to developing this console:
1. Created a dummy data of items to surf through, intentionally made their ID numbers for faster sort

2. Looped through the item to display to the viewer what we have in stock

3. Drafted a while loop to help clients pick add items to cart and limited the loop the the num of items in stock(Just a temp function for this task) 

4. Specified a break loop to leave the loop if client inputs "break" on his prompt

5. Prints a the list of selected items with the calculated total

PS: Please test code on your web browser cause "prompt" doesnt run on console. Thank you
