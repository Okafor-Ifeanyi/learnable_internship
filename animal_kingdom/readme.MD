Task on Javascript Fundamentals - Remodel the Animal kingdom that was previously modeled by that girl that did not do it well

A Breif run through of my code

How the Code Works

1. Class animal kingdom is an abstract clas and can only Inherited from another class, It has 3 methods (eye, bloodtype, backbone) and a property (num_of_eye)

2. Class Coldblooded and Class Warmblooded are normal classes inheriting from Class Animal Kingdom to define the bloodtype Method
    - class Coldblooded defines the bloodtype method as coldblooded "console.log("This family is Cold Blooded")"
    - Class Warmblooded defines the bloodtype methos as warmblooded "console.log("This family is Warm Blooded")"

3. From this point we have a basis of which category all animal families should belong too by grouping them in either cold blooded or Warm blooded

4. The rest of the classes form line 33 represent the 6 familie's in the Animal Kingdom and have the following features
    - Each class extends from their particular blood type 
    - Defines their backbone method gotten in them

5. From line 70 - 75 is a repeatitive block of code that instantiates the Family class and calls out
    - The name of the class
    - bloodtype
    - backbone
    - eat attribute
    - 1 line gap

This Task is focused around on Inheritance, Abstract, Polymorphism and Encapsulation, the attributes taught in the last Lecture Category. All attributes where included @:
    - Inheritance - line 21, 27, 33, 39 ....
    - Abstraction - line 3 - 5, 15, 18
    - Polymoprhism - line 22 - 25, 28 - 31, 34 - 37 .....
    - Encapsulation - line 8 - 10, 11 - 13
