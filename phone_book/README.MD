A Telephone book drafted soley to explain the observer pattern, a major design pattern. Desgin patterns are defined as common patterns or structures that come up in a project. 


Observer pattern is a design pattern that holds in a a class {a list of subjects(observers), a number of related modules and updates them when any effect is made towards them} , A good example of this would be a Youtube page, Imagine you own a youtube channels and get a lot of viewers, so basically you would want to turn them to subscribers, this is where an observer pattern comes in. How it works 
1. First create your Subject class, 
2. You create an empty list to store subscribers
3. You Create an add funciton for anyone who clicks the Subscribe button
4. You create a remove button for anyone who wants to be unsubscribed
5. You create a notify button so each time you post you create a flow control to send a message to all your subscribers
6. You cann add whatever you want from here, like getindex or any ohter asthetic future
7. From this point, you can just close your class and start instantiating for use

This pattern is a brief explanation of what your going to see in my Code and a little bit more.
